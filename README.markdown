This is an Emacs configuration collected by someone who really likes
the idea behind Emacs, but digs the modal editing of Vim much more for
plain day-to-day stuff. It uses Evil to alleviate that pain.

I've previously had an emacs.d repo, which is now archived to the `emacs23` branch. The current `master` branch is intended to be a modern Emacs 24-based rewrite. I am however still ignoring package.el in favor of el-get, because the latter is able to actually access anything and everything, and I think that simple git repositories are the way to go over ELPA, MELPA and Marmalade.
